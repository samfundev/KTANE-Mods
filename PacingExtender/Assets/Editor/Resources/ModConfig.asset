  title: Pacing Extender
  description: "[h1]About[/h1]\r\nPacing Extender adds more functionality to the existing
    game's pacing events, which includes:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Repeating events instead
    of just having two for the whole bomb.\r\n[*] Adding support with the Multiple
    Bombs mod.\r\n[*] Adding a better success rating calculation to the game.\r\n[*]
    Disabling and configuring individual events to control if / when they appear.\r\n[*]
    Allowing mod authors to be able to add new events to the game.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Configuration
    Options[/h1]\r\nA configuration file can be found in the mod settings folder in
    a file called PacingExtender.json, here is an explanation of the options:\r\n[list]\r\n[*]
    Min - The minimum number of seconds that can be picked for the timer to the next
    pacing event.\r\n[*] Max - The maximum number of seconds that can be picked for
    the timer to the next pacing event.\r\n[*] AbsoluteMinimum - The minimum number
    of seconds until the next pacing event, no matter how high your success rating
    is. See the Next Event Timing section below for more information.\r\n[*] Debug
    - Shows debug information like the timer to the next event and what the current
    success rating is.\r\n[*] EventSettings - This setting allows you to control individual
    event settings. See the Event Settings section below for more information.\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Leaderboards
    and Missions[/h1]\r\nPacing Extender doesn't activate in missions until after
    the game's regular pacing events play.\r\nThis is to prevent users to get an advantage
    over users not using this mod.\r\n\r\n[h1]The Algorithm[/h1]\r\nThis section describes
    the algorithm that Pacing Extender uses.\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [b]Success Rating[/b]\r\nPacing
    Extender trys to calculate your success rating based on how well you are keeping
    up to the pace of the bomb.\r\nFor example: A 10 module bomb with 10 minutes expects
    you to have a module solved every minute.\r\n\r\n[*] [b]Next Event Timing[/b]\r\nYour
    success rating controls how quickly the timer ticks down to your next pacing event.\r\nFor
    example: If your success rating is 150%, the timer will tick down one and half
    a seconds every second.\r\nUse the setting AbsoluteMinimum to control the minimum
    number of seconds that must pass before you can get another pacing event.\r\n\r\n[*]
    [b]Event Settings[/b]\r\nThe EventSettings option will be automatically populated
    after a bomb with any new events that were added that bomb.\r\nYou can control
    an individual event by using these settings:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Enabled - Allows
    the event to be picked while Pacing Extender is active.\r\n[*] Weight - Sets the
    weight that an event has compared to other events.\r\nFor example: A event with
    a weight of 2 is twice as likely to show up compared to an event that has a weight
    of 1.\r\n[*] MinRating - Prevents a event from being picked if your success rating
    is below this number.\r\nFor example: 0.5 would only allow that event to spawn
    if your success rating is 50% or higher.\r\n[/list]\r\n[/list]"
